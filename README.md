# Tower of Hanoi

## Purpose

This was to help me learn how to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript. In the early stages it also helped me learn the
HTML Click and Drag API, along with other draggable functionality, though it didn't keep that functionality throughout
the development process.

## "Final" Product

Now, the app is a fully functional "Tower of Hanoi" game that you can try out for yourself
[here](https://tower.wesstep.com).

## Going Forward

You may have noticed that "Final" is in quotes, and for a good reason. As is, the game plays well and performs without
any issues. However, in the future there may be new features added such as a game timer, a way to select how many rings
to start with, and making it more mobile friendly.

## Invitation

If you would like to, please try out the game. Feel free to leave any suggestions/PRs for improvements, and I'll do my
best to address/implement those changes.
